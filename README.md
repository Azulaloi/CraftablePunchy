# CraftablePunchy

An 'extremely simple' mod to add a craftable punchy. 
Once functionality is complete, the Inert Punchy will be craftable at a loom.
The Inert Punchy can be placed as a sleeping punchy and activated to spawn punchy.
An additional item will allow the re-inertation of the active punchy.
